    white and black, respectively.

    Args:
        game (tfg.games.GameEnv): Game to be played.
        white (tfg.strategies.Strategy): Strategy for WHITE player.
        black (tfg.strategies.Strategy): Strategy for BLACK player.
        games (:obj:`int`, optional): Number of games that will be played.
            If max_workers is None they will be played iteratively.
            Otherwise, games / max_workers will be played iteratively by each
            worker. Defaults to 1.
        max_workers (:obj:`int`, optional): If set, maximum number of processes
            that will be launched to play simultaneously. Not recommended if
            one of the players is tfg.strategies.HumanStrategy. Defaults to
            None.
        render (:obj:`bool`, optional): Whether to render the game after every
            turn or not. Defaults to False.
        print_results (:obj:`bool`, optional): Whether to print the results at
            the end of each game. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        (:obj;`int`, :obj;`int`, :obj;`int`): Cumulative results of all games
            in the format (WHITE wins, draws, BLACK wins).
