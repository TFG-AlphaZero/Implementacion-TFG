# Deep Learning Applied to Turn-based Board Games
This project is a Final Degree Project for Computer Science at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

In this project, we develop our own version of AlphaZero, capable of being executed on a personal computer.

## Getting Started 🚀

The repository is divided into multiple folders:
 - **tfg**: the core of the project is in this folder. The implementation is divided into several modules: game representation, strategies, neural network and the actual AlphaZero. 
 - **game**: games implementation are found in this folder.
 - **models**: in this folder we store some neural network models and checkpoints for saving and testing purposes.
 - **experiments**: in this folder we keep the jupyter notebooks that were used for testing the implementation.

### Prerequisites 📋

See [Requirements](https://github.com/TFG-AlphaZero/Implementacion-TFG/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## Running the code ⚙️

The code may be executed from any Jupyter notebooks included in the experiments folder. 
You can also directly instantiate and call AlphaZero class in a python file.
