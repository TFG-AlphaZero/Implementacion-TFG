# Deep Learning Applied to Turn-based Board Games
This project is part of the Final Degree Project for Computer Science at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

In this project, we develop our own version of AlphaZero, capable of being executed on a personal computer.

## Getting Started üöÄ

The repository is divided into multiple folders:
 - [tfg](https://github.com/TFG-AlphaZero/Implementacion-TFG/tree/master/tfg): the core of the project is in this folder. The implementation is divided into several modules: game representation, strategies, neural network and the actual AlphaZero. 
 - [game](https://github.com/TFG-AlphaZero/Implementacion-TFG/tree/master/game): games implementation are found in this folder.
 - [models](https://github.com/TFG-AlphaZero/Implementacion-TFG/tree/master/models): in this folder we store some neural network models and checkpoints for saving and testing purposes.
 - [experiments](https://github.com/TFG-AlphaZero/Implementacion-TFG/tree/master/experiments): in this folder we keep the Jupyter Notebooks that were used for testing the implementation.

### Prerequisites üìã

See [Requirements](https://github.com/TFG-AlphaZero/Implementacion-TFG/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## Running the code ‚öôÔ∏è

Tests performed may be executed from any Jupyter Notebooks included in the experiments folder. 
You can also directly instantiate and call AlphaZero class.
